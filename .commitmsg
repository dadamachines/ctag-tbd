docs: flatten Plugins sidebar, move USB Audio to Hardware

Remove "Build Your Own Plugin" as a nesting parent in the sidebar so
Plugins matches the flat structure of Apps. Both sections now show
their sub-pages as direct children.

Move USB Audio Interface from Plugins to Hardware section -- it replaces
the plugin host entirely, making it an ESP32-P4 hardware capability
rather than a plugin development topic.

Sidebar now reads:
  Apps -> Bootloader & Multi-App, Development Setup, App Architecture, Debugging
  Plugins -> Desktop Simulator, Plugin Architecture, Creating a Plugin,
             Development Setup, Building & Flashing, Web API Reference
  Hardware -> ... USB Audio Interface (new)
