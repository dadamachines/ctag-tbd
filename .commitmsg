docs: move 'How it works' to end of Apps page, move USB Audio to Get Started

- Apps page: moved the architecture explainer box ('How it works: Each
  App is a firmware for the RP2350...') from the top to just before the
  toctree, so the app catalog is front and center.

- USB Audio Interface: moved from Hardware to Get Started section.
  It's a user-facing feature/mode, not a hardware spec page.

- Blog/FAQ/About order: kept as-is (Blog -> FAQ -> About), which follows
  the standard convention of news -> support -> background info.
