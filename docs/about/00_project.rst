The Project
***********

**dada tbd** is an open-source audio DSP platform for musicians, educators, and
audio developers. It runs 50+ synthesizers and effects on dedicated hardware,
controlled through a browser-based interface over WiFi.

The platform is built on `CTAG TBD <https://github.com/ctag-fh-kiel/ctag-tbd>`_,
an open-source embedded synthesizer created by
`Robert Manzke <https://www.creative-technologies.de/>`_ at Kiel University of
Applied Sciences.

The **dadamachines TBD-16** is the first standalone desktop version --- a complete
instrument with standard MIDI, high-quality audio I/O, and Ableton Link, designed
to bring open-source audio processing beyond Eurorack.


What dadamachines Contributes
=============================

This repository is a fork of
`ctag-fh-kiel/ctag-tbd <https://github.com/ctag-fh-kiel/ctag-tbd>`_
(branch ``p4_main``), adapted for the TBD-16 hardware. Our focus:

- **UI/UX** --- Redesigned web interface with musician-friendly interaction patterns
- **Documentation** --- Clear guides, example workflows, and UX guidelines for
  plugin developers
- **Desktop Hardware** --- Standalone form factor with standard MIDI, no Eurorack required
- **Hardware Products** --- TBD-16 instrument, Main PCB with FFC connector, custom integrations

The DSP engine, plugin system, and core firmware are developed upstream by
Robert Manzke / CTAG.
