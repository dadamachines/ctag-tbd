TBD-16
******

The TBD-16 is a standalone desktop audio DSP instrument by
`dadamachines <https://dadamachines.com>`_. It runs the open-source CTAG TBD
audio engine in a compact desktop form factor with a full hardware interface ---
no computer, no Eurorack case required.


Overview
========

The TBD-16 is a complete instrument out of the box. Just plug a USB-C cable
into one of the two power ports on the back and it boots into the default
Groovebox / Drum Machine firmware with 16 tracks --- start making music
immediately, no computer required.

Hardware Interface
------------------

- **30 buttons** --- Transport, track select, mute, pattern controls
- **4 endless potentiometers** (with push-switch) --- 360-degree rotation for
  parameter control
- **2.4" OLED display** --- 128 × 64 pixels, shows track state, menus, and
  parameter values
- **19 RGB LEDs** --- Visual feedback for track state, sequencing, and modes

Capabilities
------------

- **50+ DSP plugins** --- Synthesizers, effects, drum machines, granular engines, and more
- **Two independent channels** --- Run any two plugins simultaneously
- **Standard MIDI** --- 4x TRS 3.5 mm (Type-A) and USB MIDI, no adapters needed
- **Ableton Link** --- Wireless tempo sync with any Link-enabled device on your network
- **Portable** --- Works with a USB power bank; an optional
  `power bank mount <https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0BCK5Y852>`_ lets you play
  anywhere
- **Web interface** --- WiFi-based configuration and preset management
  (not required for making sound)
- **Open source** --- Create your own plugins in C++, test with the simulator, flash to hardware

     - Responsibilities
   * - **ESP32-P4**
     - DSP Engine
     - Audio processing, plugin management, WiFi web server, Ableton Link
   * - **RP2350**
     - Front-End
     - User interface, MIDI processing, sequencers, arpeggiators, generators
   * - **ESP32-C6**
     - WiFi
     - WiFi co-processor (managed by the P4)

The P4 and RP2350 communicate via SPI. The RP2350 sends control data (knobs, buttons,
MIDI) to the P4, and the P4 sends status and Ableton Link data back.
