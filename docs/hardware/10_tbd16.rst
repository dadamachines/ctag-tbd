TBD-16
******

The TBD-16 is a standalone desktop audio DSP instrument by
`dadamachines <https://dadamachines.com>`_. It runs the open-source CTAG TBD
audio engine in a compact desktop form factor with standard MIDI connectivity ---
no Eurorack case required.


Overview
========

The TBD-16 is a complete instrument out of the box. It ships pre-flashed and
configured, ready to make sound the moment you plug it in.

- **50+ plugins** --- Synthesizers, effects, drum machines, granular engines, and more
- **Two independent channels** --- Run any two plugins simultaneously
- **Browser-based control** --- Full web UI served over WiFi, accessible from any device
- **Standard MIDI** --- 4x TRS 3.5 mm (Type-A) and USB MIDI, no adapters needed
- **Ableton Link** --- Wireless tempo sync with any Link-enabled device on your network
- **CV/Trigger inputs** --- Modulate any parameter from external hardware
- **Open source** --- Create your own plugins in C++, test with the simulator, flash to hardware

   * - Chip
     - Role
     - Responsibilities
   * - **ESP32-P4**
     - DSP Engine
     - Audio processing, plugin management, WiFi web server, Ableton Link
   * - **RP2350**
     - Front-End
     - User interface, MIDI processing, hardware I/O, optional sequencer
   * - **ESP32-C6**
     - WiFi
     - WiFi co-processor (managed by the P4)

The P4 and RP2350 communicate via SPI. The RP2350 sends control data (knobs, buttons,
MIDI) to the P4, and the P4 sends status and Ableton Link data back.
