Custom Integration
*******************

For manufacturers and instrument designers who need full control over every aspect
of their product, dadamachines offers custom integration of the TBD platform
directly onto your PCB.

Instead of using a pre-built module, you integrate the ESP32-P4, RP2350, audio codec,
and supporting components directly into your product's circuit board --- giving you
complete freedom over form factor, connectors, cost optimization, and production scaling.


What We Offer
=============

dadamachines is a team of experts in:

- **Hardware design** --- Schematic capture, PCB layout, signal integrity
- **Electronics engineering** --- Power management, audio circuit design, EMC compliance
- **Industrial design** --- Enclosure design, manufacturing-ready mechanical engineering
- **UX/UI design** --- Interaction design, display interfaces, control surface ergonomics

We work as collaborators, not just vendors. Whether you're a synth maker, a studio
equipment company, or an artist building a one-of-a-kind instrument, we can help you
bring your product from concept to production.


How It Works
============

1. **Consultation** --- We discuss your product concept, requirements, and timeline.
2. **Architecture** --- We help you select the right components and define the
   system architecture based on the TBD platform.
3. **Design** --- We design the PCB, enclosure, and interaction model in collaboration
   with your team.
4. **Prototyping** --- We build and validate prototypes, including firmware customization.
5. **Production support** --- We help you prepare for manufacturing with DFM-optimized
   designs and test procedures.


Core Components

   * - Component
     - Purpose
   * - **ESP32-P4**
     - Audio DSP engine, WiFi server, plugin management
   * - **RP2350**
     - User interface, MIDI, hardware I/O, sequencer
   * - **ESP32-C6**
     - WiFi co-processor (optional, for wireless control)
   * - **Audio codec**
     - ADC/DAC for professional-grade audio I/O
   * - **Power management**
     - Voltage regulation, USB power delivery

All firmware and the full plugin library work out of the box on custom hardware.
You can also develop custom plugins specific to your product.


Why Custom Over a Module?
=========================

- **Lower BOM cost at scale** --- No module markup, optimized component selection
- **Smaller form factor** --- Place components exactly where you need them
- **Custom I/O** --- Choose your own connectors, jack types, control count
- **Brand identity** --- No visible third-party modules; your product is truly yours
- **Production control** --- Full ownership of your supply chain
