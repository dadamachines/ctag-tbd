Your TBD-16 ships ready to use --- just plug in power and make music.


1. Plug In & Play
------------------

1. Connect a **USB-C cable** to port #1 or #2 on the back (any USB-C power
   source: laptop, wall adapter, power bank).
2. Connect **speakers or headphones** to the audio jacks (TRS 3.5 mm).
3. The TBD-16 boots in seconds into the **Groovebox / Drum Machine** with
   16 tracks --- start pressing buttons and turning knobs.

No computer, no WiFi, no software installation needed.

.. warning::

   **Do not plug modular signals directly into the line input.**
   Modular signals run hot and can damage the inputs. Attenuate first with an
   interface module (e.g. `Intellijel Audio Interface II <https://modulargrid.net/e/intellijel-audio-interface-ii>`_).

hardware interface, firmware modes, and MIDI.


2. Connect WiFi (Optional)
----------------------------

The TBD-16 creates its own WiFi network out of the box:

- **SSID:** ``ctag-tbd`` (no password)
- Open a browser → ``http://ctag-tbd.local``
- Manage presets, browse plugins, configure settings

WiFi also enables **Ableton Link** --- wireless tempo sync with Ableton Live,
iOS apps, and any Link-enabled device on the same network.

Link details.


3. Storage & Samples
---------------------

The TBD-16 has two SD card slots. The main SD card (P4) stores configuration,
the web UI, and audio samples. You can add your own samples via USB or by
removing the card.

(44.1 kHz 16-bit mono), and bank management.
