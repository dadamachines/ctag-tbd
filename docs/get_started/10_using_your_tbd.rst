Using Your TBD-16
*********************

Your TBD-16 ships ready to use. This page walks you through connecting,
accessing the web interface, and making sound.


1. Connect
==========

- Plug a **USB-C cable into one of the two ports on the back** of the TBD-16 for power.
- Connect your audio output (speakers, headphones, mixer) to the audio jacks.
- Optionally connect MIDI gear via the TRS MIDI ports or USB MIDI.

The TBD-16 boots in a few seconds. The front panel controls and display become active.


2. Open the Web Interface
=========================

The TBD-16 is controlled through a browser-based interface served over WiFi.

**First time (Access Point mode):**

1. On your computer or phone, look for the WiFi network **ctag-tbd** (no password).
2. Join it.
3. Open a browser and go to ``http://ctag-tbd.local``.

You'll see the TBD-16 control page where you can select plugins and adjust parameters.

.. tip::

   To connect TBD-16 to your existing WiFi instead, see :doc:`WiFi & Firmware Updates <15_wifi_and_updates>`.


3. Select a Plugin
==================

The TBD-16 has two independent audio channels. Each channel can run any of the
50+ available plugins --- synthesizers, effects, drum machines, and more.

Use the web interface to:

- Browse the plugin library
- Load a plugin on either channel
- Tweak parameters in real time using the on-screen controls or the front panel knobs


4. Make Sound
=============

- **Synthesizers** generate sound autonomously --- just load one and you'll hear output.
- **Effects** process audio coming in through the audio inputs.
- Use the **front panel knobs and buttons** for hands-on control, or adjust
  parameters via the web UI.
- Connect **MIDI** to play synthesizers chromatically or trigger events.


5. Use CV & Triggers (Optional)
===============================

The front panel provides CV inputs and trigger inputs. These allow external
modular gear or expression pedals to modulate plugin parameters in real time.

You assign CV and trigger sources to any parameter through the web interface ---
just click a parameter to see its modulation options.
