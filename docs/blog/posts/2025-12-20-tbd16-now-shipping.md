# TBD-16 — Now Shipping

We are thrilled to announce that the dadamachines TBD-16 is now shipping
to customers worldwide.

The TBD-16 is the first standalone desktop audio DSP platform based on
the open-source CTAG TBD project. It brings 50+ high-quality generators
and effects to a compact desktop form factor with standard MIDI
connectivity — no Eurorack required.

## What's in the box

- TBD-16 unit with aluminum enclosure
- USB-C power/data cable
- MIDI breakout cable (3.5mm TRS to 5-pin DIN)
- Quick start card

## Getting started

Head over to our [Getting Started](../../get_started/index) guide to set up
your TBD-16, connect to the web interface, and start making sound.

Thank you to everyone who supported this project. We are just getting started.
