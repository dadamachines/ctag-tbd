# Firmware v1.2 — What's New

We have just released firmware version 1.2 for the TBD-16. This update brings
performance improvements, bug fixes, and two new sound processors.

## New plugins

- **SpaceFX** — A stereo reverb/delay hybrid with modulated feedback paths.
  Great for ambient textures and rhythmic echoes.
- **BjorklundSeq** — An Euclidean sequencer that generates rhythmic patterns
  from simple parameters. Ideal for generative percussion.

## Improvements

- Reduced audio latency by 15% across all plugins.
- Fixed a bug where MIDI CC mapping would reset after power cycle.
- Improved web UI responsiveness on mobile devices.
- Sample ROM loading is now 2× faster.

## How to update

Follow the [Flash & Updates](../../flash/index) guide to install the latest firmware
via USB or OTA.
