- **Tutorials** — Step-by-step guides for building patches, creating plugins, and integrating MIDI.
- **Behind the scenes** — Technical deep-dives into DSP algorithms, hardware design decisions, and architecture choices.
- **Community** — Showcases of instruments, performances, and projects built with TBD.
