TBD "to be determined" is an open-source platform for audio DSP experimentation,
learning, and research, bringing together high-quality generators and effects 
within a modular, easily extensible architecture.

This repository is a fork of the CTAG TBD project, conceived within the
Creative Technologies Arbeitsgruppe of Kiel University of Applied Sciences:

The core platform and original hardware designs were developed by Robert Manzke.
The TBD-16 standalone hardware and updated software/UI/UX were developed as
a joint effort between Robert Manzke and Johannes Elias Lohbihler (dadamachines).
