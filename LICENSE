dadamachines TBD-16 / CTAG TBD

TBD "to be determined" is an open-source platform for audio DSP experimentation,
learning, and research, bringing together high-quality generators and effects
within a modular, easily extensible architecture.

This repository is a fork of the CTAG TBD project, conceived within the
Creative Technologies Arbeitsgruppe of Kiel University of Applied Sciences:
https://www.creative-technologies.de

The core platform and original hardware designs were developed by Robert Manzke.
The TBD-16 standalone hardware and updated software/UI/UX were developed as
a joint effort between Robert Manzke and Johannes Elias Lohbihler (dadamachines).

The dadamachines TBD-16 is a commercial product. Its specific hardware
design is proprietary and not released under an open-source license.
However, updated open hardware reference designs for the TBD platform
are planned for future publication in KiCad to foster education,
prototyping, and instrument design.


THE DADAMACHINES NAME AND BRAND
-------------------------------
The dadamachines name, logo, and TBD-16 product name are trademarks of
dadamachines and are reserved for products produced by or licensed by
dadamachines.

If you build a product using the TBD platform, you may reference it as:
  - [YourProduct] for TBD
  - [YourProduct] (TBD-compatible)

Using "dadamachines [YourProduct]" or "TBD-16 [YourProduct]" is not
permitted without prior agreement.


COMMERCIAL USE
--------------
If you want to build a product around the TBD platform, two options are
designed for you:

  - TBD-Core: Our core DSP board with all audio, MIDI, and USB I/O
    assembled. Connect your own UI board via the 30-pin FFC connector
    and design your own enclosure.
  - Custom Integration: We integrate the ESP32-P4, RP2350, and codec
    directly onto your PCB for full control over form factor, connectors,
    and BOM.

We also offer volume pricing for TBD-16 units used as finished components
inside your products.

See https://dadamachines.com/contact/ for details.

If you modify the dadamachines-added code (WebUI, tools, documentation) and
distribute it, those modifications must be released under LGPL 3.0. If you
would like to keep your modifications proprietary, dadamachines can provide
a commercial license. Contact us: https://dadamachines.com/contact/
